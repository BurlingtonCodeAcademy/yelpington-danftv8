    "hours": "12pm-8pm",
    "notes": "Central location, great beers on tap from the in-house Zero Gravity microbrewery and superb flatbread (thin-crust pizza) are reason enough to visit this bustling downtown eatery. Throw in an outdoor summer terrace in the back alleyway, and you have one of Burlington's most appealing restaurants."
