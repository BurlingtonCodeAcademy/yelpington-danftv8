    "notes": "Nice atmosphere and staff and drinks but bit overpriced for the food quality. The menu sounds impressive but $6 for a trio of olives - an ordinary bowl (of 3 types)  one might get for free elsewhere.the blueberry and chilli jam upon salmon  didn't work and the salmon wasn't super fresh. Avocado cake and spinach on the side were good.  A simpler more conventional french menu better executed would have done the trick. Wish I'd had the boeuf bourginon."
